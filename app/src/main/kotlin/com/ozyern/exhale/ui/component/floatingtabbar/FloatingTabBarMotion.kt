 * right edge retracts into the circle, on expand the circle grows back out. Sharing their
 * bounds makes that a continuous resize; before, they were two unrelated trees that
 * cross-faded (pill vanished, circle popped in).
 *
 * Both backgrounds sit inside the shared node, so the fades are short and overlap: the
 * outgoing labels have to clear in about two frames (the reference blurs them out first)
 * without the glass thinning out between the two backgrounds.
